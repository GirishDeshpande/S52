Introduction

The Object Catalogue is the data schema for "S-57 - The IHO Transfer 
Standard for Digital Hydrographic Data". Its primary function is to 
provide a means of describing real world entities. That is entities 
which actually exist (either physically such as a beacon or legally 
such as an anchorage area) in the real world. The Object Catalogue is 
based on the theoretical model described in Part 2 of this Standard. 
The model assumes that real world entities can be categorized into a 
finite number of types, such as lights, wrecks, built up areas etc. 
These entity types are termed feature object classes in the Object 
Catalogue. An instance of a feature object class, referred to as a 
feature object, (that is one specific light or wreck or built up area) 
can be more precisely described by assigning to it a number of 
attributes and then specifying values for those attributes. A 
particular real world entity is encoded by specifying the appropriate 
feature object class, attributes and attribute values. For example, a 
red lateral buoy would be encoded as follows:- feature object class: 
buoy lateral; attribute: colour; attribute value: red.

The data model defines four types of feature object:

Geo containing the descriptive characteristics of a real world 
 entity.

Meta containing information about other objects (eg. 
 compilation scale, vertical datum).

Collection containing information about the relationships 
 between other objects. 

Cartographic containing information about the cartographic 
 representation of a real world entity.

Chapter 1 contains a description of each feature object class. This 
includes a definition of the class and a list of the attributes that 
are allowed for that class. Instructions on how to interpret the 
information associated with each feature object class are given in the 
introduction to Chapter 1.

The Object Catalogue does not mandate the use of any attributes. 
However, for each instance of a feature object, a particular attribute 
may only be used once. In general terms it is up to the encoder to 
select from the appropriate list the attributes that are relevant to a 
particular object instance. However, for some applications, certain 
attributes may be designated as mandatory for specific object classes. 
These attributes will be listed in the appropriate product 
specification (see S-57 Appendix B).

A description of each attribute is contained in Chapter 2. This 
includes a definition of the attribute and, where appropriate, a list 
of allowable values, also with definitions. Instructions on how to 
interpret the information associated with each attribute are given in 
the introduction to Chapter 2.

For the purposes of backward compatibility, changes from edition 2.0 
of S-57 have been emphasized in the table of contents by striking out 
object classes or attributes that have been deleted and by marking 
those that have been added in the margin.  In addition, pages in the 
Object Catalogue relating to deleted object classes or attributes have 
been retained with the remark "DELETED - DO NOT USE".  Where a deleted 
object class or attribute has been replaced by another one, this is 
specified at the bottom of the page in bold characters.

1.1 Introduction


Each object class is specified in a standardized way, under the 
following headings:

· Object Class:  object class name

· Acronym:  six_character code for the object class

· Code: integer code to be used in the coding of data

· For each object class the set of relevant attributes is 
 defined. This set is divided into three subsets:

* subset `Attribute_A': Attributes in this subset define the 
 individual characteristics of an object;

* subset `Attribute_B': Attributes in this subset provide 
 information relevant to the use of the data, e.g. for 
 presentation or for an information system;

* subset `Attribute_C': Attributes in this subset provide 
 administrative information about the object and the data 
 describing it;

Each subset shows a list of ASCII attribute acronyms. For the 
description of each attribute see Chapter 2.

· Definition: Where possible each object class is 
 defined and the source of the definition is quoted.

· References:

* INT 1: reference to the number of the paper chart feature in 
 the `International Chart Series INT 1 _ Symbols, 
 Abbreviations, Terms used on Charts'. INT 1 was one of the 
 major guidelines for the definition of object classes.

* M-4: reference to the paragraph number in the `Chart 
 Specifications  of   the   IHO',  publication M-4. This was 
 another guideline used in the definition and description of 
 object classes.

· Remarks: Under `Remarks' further comments and notes 
 are given. Related but separate object classes are listed 
 under the heading `Distinction'.

certain busy waterways and port approaches to assist traffic control. 
On passing these points or crossing a defined line vessels are 
required to report on VHF to a Traffic Control Centre. (adapted from

positions.

This object is obsolete. It is only shown here for reasons of backward 
compatibility. Survey source should be encoded under survey 
reliability (M_SREL).

 COLLECTION OBJECT CLASSES



Object Class: Aggregation

Acronym: C_AGGR  Code: 400

Set Attribute_C:      RECDAT; RECIND; SORDAT; SORIND;


Definition:
-----------

Used to identify an aggregation of two or more objects.  This 
aggregation may be named.

Remarks:

An aggregation could be used to combine objects that are related in 
some way (is-a-part-of, is-a-component-of) into a higher level object.

For example: an aggregation relationship may be used to form a traffic 
separation scheme from traffic separation lane parts, boundaries, etc.

Shallow water blue $SHABL

Set Attribute_B:      INFORM; NINFOM; NTXTDS; PICREP; SCAMAX;

Set Attribute_C:      RECDAT; RECIND; SORDAT; SORIND;


Definition:
-----------

An area that is to be cartographically represented by a `shallow water 
blue' tint.

Remarks:

To be used to define depth areas which need to be coloured blue (since 
the limits of the shallow water blue areas on paper charts are not 
universally standardised). Corresponding cartographic objects are not 
required for land area (buff tint) and intertidal area (green tint), 
since these can be deduced from existing real world objects.

This object class is obsolete. It is only included here for reasons of 
backward compatibility. Shallow water blue areas should be encoded 
using the object class cartographic area ($AREAS).

in graphical form with particular positioning and display 
characteristics.

Rotation and curving of text can be handled by the use of 2 or more 
x,y coordinate pairs in the associated spatial object.
